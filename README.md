# stream_metals_machine_learning

This performs various analyses on stream and soil data (metals, nutrients) collected in the San Francisquito Creek watershed from 2015-2017, primarily for the purpose of exploratory data analysis and methods demonstration. This is a dataset where n is approximately the same size as p.

In the first half of the code, PO4 is regressed on the ramaining metals and nutrients using PCA regression, partial least squares, and LASSO. Model performance should be evaluated using cross-validation. The second half performs unsupervised learning/clustering using PCA and K-means clustering.
